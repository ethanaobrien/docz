## Firmware
* **All ARM Chromebooks**: No support, though development is slowly starting.
* GeminiLake: Legacy boot mode/alternative firmware menu works but does not show payload list
* AMD Stoneyridge: Some Stoney Ridge devices may not currently have functional Legacy Boot Mode due to bugs in Google's firmware.
* AMD Picasso: Booting from eMMC is not currently supported (edk2 limitation), only from NVMe and USB/SD.
* AMD Cezanne: legacy boot mode/alternative firmware menu works, edk2 boots, but screen backlight is off. Will be fixed in next Google fw update (fingers crossed).
