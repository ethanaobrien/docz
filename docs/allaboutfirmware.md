# All About Firmware

### Terminology 

| **Term** | **Description** |  
| - | - |
| coreboot     | UEFI firmware firmware replacement |  
| UEFI         | The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the legacy Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing support for legacy BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed. (source: Wikipedia) |  
| EC           | Embedded Controller. Communicates between the main board and embedded peripherals such as hotkeys, ports, or battery.

## Firmware Types

### RW_LEGACY

{: .warning }
Touchscreen and microphones that rely on the AVS driver **WILL NOT** work on RW_LEGACY!

* Updates/replaces the stock RW_LEGAGY payload (SeaBIOS or edk2) included on many older models; supplements the ChromeOS / secure boot payload (depthcharge)
* Leaves all stock functionality intact, including the Developer Mode boot screen and Recovery Mode functionality
* Allows device to dual-boot another OS alongside ChromeOS
* Does not require disabling the firmware write-protect
* Carries zero risk of bricking the device
* On many models, includes bugfixes and enables additional functionality

{: .note }
Do not run Windows on RW_LEGACY. The RW_LEGACY firmware is for users who want to dual-boot ChromeOS + Linux, or users who want to run Linux without having to open the device/disable the firmware write-protect (and are OK with the accompanying limitations).

### (UEFI) Full ROM
* A complete firmware image which includes updated/customized versions of the hardware init component (coreboot) and UEFI boot payload (edk2)
* Removes the developer mode boot ("OS verification is OFF") screen
* Completely removes the ability to run ChromeOS (and ChromeOS Recovery Mode), creating a small risk of bricking your device
* Offers the best support for booting all OSes besides ChromeOS
* Adds full hardware support for virtualization (vmx / VT-x)
* Fixes many bugs and/or idiosyncrasies associated with the stock firmware
* UEFI firmware contains updated EC firmware as well, which brings additional fixes on most Chromebooks (mainly keyboard related)
* Requires installation of a UEFI-compatible OS after flashing
* Essentially turns your ChromeOS device into a "regular" PC / laptop

{: .highlight }
The (UEFI) Full ROM firmware is the best option for all users who no longer need/want to run ChromeOS (ie, want to run Linux/Windows/macOS exclusively), and who don't mind disabling write-protection on their device
