### Asking for help properly:
If you are facing a issue, please read the [FAQ](faq.html) first.

{: .important } 
> When asking for help, ask in English. We can't help you if we don't understand the question. Using a translator is fine.

**Do not use manufacturer's model name or serial number when asking for help** (i.e: HP Chromebook 14a), it doesn't help with identifying the machine. Provide the boardname, otherwise your support request will be ignored. 

If you don't know where to find your boardname, take a look [here](system-info.html)
