## Linux

Pros:
* Free audio support 
* Lightweight and optimal for Chrultrabooks with low storage / slow CPUs
* Most hardware (biggest exception is audio) will work out of the box

Cons:
* Potentially difficult for a new user (depending on the distro of choice)
* Requires some work on the end user (running audio script, configuring keyboard mapping)
* AVS and SOF users experience instability at times

   {: .note }
   Anything Ubuntu based will **not** work, with the exception of PopOS. Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and ElementaryOS are some examples.
