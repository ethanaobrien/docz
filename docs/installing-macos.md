# Installing macOS

Before we begin, it's important to know whether your Chromebook is even supported:
- ARM/AMD CPUs are not supported.
- Intel Celeron / Pentium CPUs are not supported.
- Tiger Lake (11th gen) CPUs and newer are not supported.
- You need at least 32GB of eMMC storage.

**You will also need:**
* Patience 
    * This is not a one click setup thing. It usually takes one or more weeks to have a stable hack.
* A USB drive 
  	* 4 gigabytes or more for a online installer.
  	* 32 gigabytes or more for offline installer.
* The ability to use a command line
  	* We won't help you if you don't know how to `cd` to a directory.

## Known Issues

- Broken NVRAM on Comet Lake Devices
   	- To fix this, **DISABLE** `DevirtualiseMmio`.
   	{: .warning}
   	If your device has a Comet Lake CPU, this MUST be disabled.
    
- Waking from sleep causes:
   - Blank Electron / Chromium apps
   - Buggy video playback in web browsers like Firefox or Safari
   - Display/Wallpaper settings in SysPref/SysSettings
   - Logging out freezes your system

## Installation

**Getting Started:**

1. Follow the [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide).
2. Follow the laptop guide for your CPU generation
	* Amber Lake Chromebooks should follow the Kaby Lake config.plist setup
3. As necessary, add the following Kexts and SSDTs to your EFI:

Firmware Fixes:
  	* [croscorebootpatch](https://github.com/meghan06/croscorebootpatch): Fixes freeze during boot when using coreboot 4.20 and newer

Keyboard:
	* [VoodooPS2.kext](https://github.com/1Revenger1/VoodooPS2/releases): Fork of Acidanthera's VoodooPS2 which allows mapping keyboard brightness and other useful keys
	* [Keyboard Map](https://github.com/1Revenger1/Acer-Spin-713-Hackintosh/blob/main/src/ACPI/SSDT-ChromeKeys.dsl): Maps FNx keys to ChromeOS mapping. This is an example, you may need to do your own mapping.
  	* Will need to be compiled with either `iASL` or `MaciASL`.

Chrome EC:
	* [CrosEC.kext](https://github.com/1Revenger1/CrosEC/releases): Adds keyboard brightness, tablet mode, and other functionality
	* [Fake Ambient Light Sensor](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/AcpiSamples/Source/SSDT-ALS0.dsl): Creates a fake ambient light sensor which is needed by macOS to recognize the keyboard backlight.
  	* This is only needed if your device does not come with a light sensor.
  	* A pre-compiled version comes in OpenCore's release zip under `Docs/AcpiSamples/Binaries/SSDT-ASL0.aml`

Storage:
  	* [EmeraldSDHC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/EmeraldSDHC/releases): eMMC driver

4. Take those files you downloaded and put the `.aml` files in the ACPI folder, and the `.kexts` into the kexts folder
5. Snapshot (cmd +r) or (ctrl + r) your `config.plist`. 

{: .warning }
If you dualboot with the SSDTs mentioned above, you might run into issues on other OSes. An `OSI_` check is not present in these SSDTs.
