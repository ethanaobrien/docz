# Installing Linux

Thanks to recent advancements in the chrultrabook community, Linux works really well on most Chromebooks.

{: .note } 
Only Linux kernel 6.4 or newer is supported.

---

## Recommended Distributions

{: .warning } 
Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distributions that are not based on 23.10 or higher **may have issues**.

{: .warning } 
Debian versions older than Debian 12 (Bookworm) are **not supported**. Debian 12 (Bookworm) requires a custom kernel, the [audio script](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs/docs/installing-linux.html#fixing-audio) will automatically install it for you.

**Recommended distros as of October 2023 (in no particular order) are:**

* Arch Linux and EndeavourOS
* Fedora
* openSUSE Tumbleweed
* Debian 12 (Bookworm)

## Installation

1. Create a bootable Linux USB. See [here](bootableusb.html) for a guide.
2. Plug the USB Drive into the Chromebook.
3. Turn on the Chromebook, press `ESC` at the POST screen (when the coreboot logo appears), and select your USB to boot from. 
4. Install as you would on any other computer.
